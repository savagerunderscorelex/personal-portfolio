            <p id="paragraphaboutme">I've been coding regularly for a couple months now. However, I've been interested in learning how to code since I was in 8th grade (Currently in 10th as I am writing this). I live
                in the Midwest, but I'm ethnically Nigerian (Yoruba). I was born in the U.S. and have spent all of my years in the Midwest (I've never moved, actually)!
                <br>
                <br>
                I wanted to learn programming in 8th grade as I wanted to stop being chronically online and get into new hobbies. Although my interest in programming at that time didn't last long, I enjoyed programming
                when I did do it. When I entered high school, I was faced with a lot of opportunities to code through online programs (Like Girls Who Code and the Athena Award), my classes (I took programming my freshman year), and through my clubs (I've been a programmer in my
                school's robotics club since last year, and I'm currently a programmer in my school's drone club as of my sophomore year). I have a big interest in programming and computer science, and I'm considering it as a major when I go off to college. 
                <br>
                Before, I was dead set on majoring in computer science when I graduated, I began to become interested in engineering when I took my Engineering Design class in my freshman year. Hearing about my teacher's experience in the military as an engineer led me to consider another STEM path. 
                I love using CAD programs (we use Onshape in school) and I loved the hands-on activities we did in class. Engineering was another topic that stretched my brain. I noticed how my engineering classes challenged me the most. Currently, I have ambitions to study computer science and civil engineering, or a field that incorporates computer science AND engineering.
